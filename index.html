    <h1>Chinmay Bharambe</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Chinmay Bharambe, a Data Science undergrad at UC San Diego.
       I'm passionate about uncovering the hidden patterns and relationships 
       within data, which is what drew me to the field of Data Science. 
       Through my studies, I get to explore the world of data analysis and 
       machine learning, constantly learning new ways to extract meaningful 
       insights from complex datasets.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I have diverse interests that keep me 
        balanced and inspired. I'm an avid Formula 1 enthusiast. I also 
        enjoy reading, which helps me gain new perspectives and knowledge.</p>
